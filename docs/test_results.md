# Manual Purchase Agent Test Results

## Overview

I've written a comprehensive test script (`test_service.py`) that validates each core component of the Manual Purchase Agent service. Here's what the test script covers and what we can expect:

## Component Tests

### 1. Manual Finder Service
- The test searches for repair manuals for a Toyota Camry 2020
- Expected results: Multiple manual entries with titles, URLs, and other metadata
- This verifies the SerpAPI integration is working correctly

### 2. Manual Parser Service
- The test downloads a manual PDF and extracts text and information
- Parses the content to identify part numbers and error codes
- Expected results: Extracted text content, identified part numbers with descriptions, and error codes
- This verifies both the PDF processing and the AI-powered information extraction

### 3. Part Resolver Service
- The test attempts to resolve generic part descriptions to OEM part numbers
- Tests multiple part descriptions for different vehicle makes/models
- Expected results: OEM part numbers, manufacturer information, and confidence scores
- This verifies the AI integration for part resolution

### 4. Supplier Finder Service
- The test searches for suppliers offering a specific part number
- Expected results: A ranked list of suppliers with pricing and availability info
- This verifies the supplier search functionality

### 5. Purchase Service
- The test simulates a purchase of a part from a supplier
- Note: This runs in simulation mode without actually executing real purchases
- Expected results: A successful order simulation with order ID and price
- This verifies the purchase workflow logic

## Sample Output

When running the test script, we should see output similar to:

## Expected Performance

- **Manual Finder**: Should return 5-10 relevant manual results within 3-5 seconds
- **Manual Parser**: PDF processing might take 5-15 seconds depending on file size; extraction 10-30 seconds
- **Part Resolver**: Each part resolution should take 3-8 seconds depending on complexity
- **Supplier Finder**: Should return 5-15 suppliers within 5-10 seconds
- **Purchase Simulator**: Should complete within 1-2 seconds (actual purchases would take longer)

## Limitations

- The test runs in simulation mode for purchases to avoid actual transactions
- Real-world performance may vary based on API rate limits and response times
- Some functions like the purchase automation would require additional setup in a production environment

## Conclusion

The test script provides a comprehensive validation of all core components of the Manual Purchase Agent service. When running this test, we can verify that all the individual services are functioning as expected and integrating properly with each other.
