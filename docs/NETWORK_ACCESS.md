# Network Access Guide

## Overview

The Manual Purchase Agent services can be accessed both locally and from other devices on your network. This guide explains how to access the services from different devices.

## Quick Start

### Start Services
```bash
./start_services.sh
```

The script will automatically display both local and network URLs:

```
üì± Local Access URLs:
   V3 Interface: http://localhost:7777/static/api-demo/v3/
   Flask API: http://localhost:7777
   Playwright API: http://localhost:3001

üåê Network Access URLs (for other devices on your network):
   V3 Interface: http://192.168.254.74:7777/static/api-demo/v3/
   Flask API: http://192.168.254.74:7777
   Playwright API: http://192.168.254.74:3001
```

### Check URLs Without Starting Services
```bash
./show_urls.sh
```

This displays the URLs and checks if services are running without starting them.

## Access Methods

### 1. Local Access (Same Computer)
Use `localhost` URLs when accessing from the same computer running the services:
- V3 Interface: `http://localhost:7777/static/api-demo/v3/`
- Flask API: `http://localhost:7777`
- Playwright API: `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Network Access (Other Devices)
Use the IP address URLs when accessing from:
- **Mobile phones** on the same WiFi network
- **Other computers** on the same network
- **Tablets** or other devices

Example: `http://192.168.254.74:7777/static/api-demo/v3/`

### 3. Mobile Testing
To test on mobile devices:
1. Connect your phone to the same WiFi network
2. Open your mobile browser
3. Enter the network URL shown by `start_services.sh`
4. The V3 interface is mobile-responsive

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access from Other Devices?

1. **Check Firewall Settings**
   - macOS: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall
   - Allow incoming connections for Python
   - Allow ports 7777 and 3001

2. **Verify Network Connection**
   - Ensure devices are on the same network
   - Check WiFi connection on mobile devices

3. **Test Connection**
   ```bash
   # From another device, test if the port is accessible
   curl http://192.168.254.74:7777/api/system/health
   ```

4. **Wrong IP Address?**
   - Run `./show_urls.sh` to get current IP
   - IP addresses can change when reconnecting to network

### Security Notes

- Services bind to `0.0.0.0` to allow network access
- Only accessible within your local network
- Not exposed to the internet unless you configure port forwarding
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Port Numbers
Edit the scripts to use different ports:
```bash
# In start_services.sh
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080  # Change Flask port
PORT=3002 npm run start:api            # Change Playwright port
```

### Restrict to Local Only
To disable network access and only allow localhost:
```bash
# In start_services.sh
flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7777  # Local only
```

### Static IP Configuration
For consistent URLs, configure a static IP on your network:
1. Check router settings for DHCP reservation
2. Assign static IP to your computer's MAC address
3. URLs will remain consistent across restarts

## Recording Studio Access

The Recording Studio is a local GUI application and cannot be accessed remotely. To use it:
```bash
cd recording_studio
python3 start_recording_studio.py
```

This must be run on the computer with display access.

## API Testing from Network

Test API endpoints from other devices:

```bash
# From another computer or using a REST client on mobile
curl http://192.168.254.74:7777/api/system/health

# Test manual search
curl -X POST http://192.168.254.74:7777/api/manuals/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"make":"Toyota", "model":"Camry"}'
```

## Tips

- **Bookmark the URLs** on your mobile devices for quick access
- **Use the Admin Portal** from tablets for better experience
- **Network URLs work** for all services (API, web interface, etc.)
- **Recording Studio** must be used locally (not network accessible)
