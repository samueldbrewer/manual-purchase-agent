## 📋 **Clean Architecture**

The system now has a clean, focused architecture:

```
manual-purchase-agent/
├── api/                    # REST API endpoints
├── services/              # Core business logic  
├── models/                # Database models
├── static/                # Web interface
├── templates/             # HTML templates
├── utils/                 # Utility functions
└── uploads/               # File storage
```

**No browser automation dependencies or complexity.**
**Focus on core manual search, enrichment, and data management.**
