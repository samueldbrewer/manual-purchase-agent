# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
Railway deployment is failing. I've created multiple solutions to fix this.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Minimal App (Fastest Fix)
Update `railway.toml` to use the minimal Dockerfile:

```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile.minimal"
```

This deploys a simple Flask app to test basic functionality.

### Option 2: Use Simplified Full App
Update `railway.toml` to use:

```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile.simple"
```

This includes core functionality with minimal dependencies.

### Option 3: Environment Variables Issue
The deployment might be failing due to missing environment variables. 

**In Railway Dashboard, set these REQUIRED variables:**
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=manual-purchase-agent-production-secret-key-2024
SERPAPI_KEY=7219228e748003a6e5394610456ef659f7c7884225b2df7fb0a890da61ad7f48
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your service settings
   - Find "Variables" tab
   - Add the environment variables above

2. **OR Update Dockerfile:**
   - Go to your service settings
   - Under "Source" â†’ "Root Directory" settings
   - Look for build configuration
   - Change Dockerfile path to `Dockerfile.minimal`

3. **Trigger Redeploy:**
   - Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button
